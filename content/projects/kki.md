This project was for my S431 Linear Models course. In this project my team was given a data
set from the Kennedy Krieger Institute that contained information on their social scores, motor
skills and if they had a diagnosided social disorder. This is my first project after I learned 
enough about statistics to make any substantial progress. All the source code as well as my team's
final presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/njmobley/S431Project.git)
