This project was a look at creating a model that will determine the popularity of a song based off of 
it's different attributes. The features of thes songs were plucked from the Spotify API and then merged 
with a track popularity ranking. I'm proud of this project since I was able to use non-linear models to generate 
an interpatible model. General Additive Models backfitting and smoothing were very powerful tools that really 
helped us generate some insight into how some songs can become so popular. A link to our final report with source
