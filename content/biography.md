# About Me

I am Nicholas Mobley and I'm an incoming Senior at Indiana University Bloomington.
I currently study Statistics and Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science.
My goal is to attend graduate school and obtain my PHD in either Statistics or Computer Science, regardless
of the degree my goal is to research the interoperability of "black box" machine learning models. Someday
I hope Neural Networks are as understandable as Ordinary Least Squares Regression. I currently do not have the
mathmatical or statistical prowess to do this yet. This is why I hope to continue my education past my Bachelor's 
degree. Currently I am an Undergraduate Instructor for the Intro to Programming course, C200. This course covers 
the fundementals needed for any Computer Science student. As an intro course the secondary goal is to also inspire
creativity into what we can perform with computers. Every year new students switch their major to Computer Science 
after seeing all the incredible things we can do. This excitement for learning new things is what inspires me to become a professor someday, with hopes of teaching a new generation of students tools they can use to solve 
problems, I won't be able to solve in my lifetime.

# Hobbies and Non-Academic Intrests

Sports is one of my favorite past times, it is actually the reason I got interested in Statistics! From a statistical stand point I think baseball has to be my favorite sport due to the immense amount of data available. However, from a non statistical point of view Soccer's nonstop action has to be the most entertaining. Entertainment wise I enjoy watching Anime with my girlfriend. My Hero Academia and Mob Psycho 100 have to be among my favorites! I also enjoy traveling the world. Last Summer I took a trip to Vietnam, South Korea, and Japan. The expiernce was remarkable and I've been anxious to travel once again. I frequently post pictures of my travels. Sight seeing is my personal favorite activity so I try to share that with others as much as I can!
