My girlfriend and I finshed the first season of Haikyuu!! this morning. I won't spoil anything, since every
sports fan or anime fan should give themselves the privlage of seeing it for themselves. I just want to comment
on the pacing of the final arc. My biggest gripe with most anime is the slow pacing to draw out the 25 episdoe 
season. However, this show's last arc was able to keep me on the edge of my seat, not because of the stakes but 
the characters. The show spends its' time developing all the characters instead of using the plot to drive the show. This character focused storyline has made me invested in all the asprining high school athletes, reminding
me of my time with my high school soccer team. I recommend to anybody nostaligic for their high school team to sit 
down and watch the series, you won't regret the trip down memory lane.
